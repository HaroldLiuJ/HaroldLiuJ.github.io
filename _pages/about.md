I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net). Before joining UC Davis, I completed my B.S. degree in Software Engineering at Southeast University.
My research is focused on natural language processing, particularly in the areas of text summarization, graph-based NLP techniques, multimodal learning, and large language models. Feel free to send me an email at xioliu[at]ucdavis.edu if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
