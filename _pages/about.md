I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net). Before joining UC Davis, I completed my B.S. degree in Software Engineering at Southeast University.
My research is focused on natural language processing, particularly in the areas of text summarization, graph-based NLP techniques, multimodal learning, and large language models.
